# Hospital Assistant AI üè•+ü§ñ

## Mission Statement
**"To revolutionize healthcare delivery through artificial intelligence, creating intelligent systems that enhance patient care, optimize medical workflows, and support healthcare professionals in delivering timely, effective treatment."**

## Overview
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that navigates a hospital environment to assist patients, handle emergencies, and manage medicine distribution. The system demonstrates how AI can optimize healthcare logistics and decision-making in time-sensitive scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Smart Pathfinding**: AI learns optimal routes through complex hospital layouts
- **Priority Management**: Automatically triages patients based on urgency
- **Inventory Control**: Tracks and manages medicine supplies
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves performance through continuous training
- **Visual Analytics**: Provides intuitive visualization of AI decision-making

## Technical Components
